            <h2>AIMS</h2>
            <p>I aspire to make education accessible to everyone. To donate skills in the form of education instead of tangible things will empower people. To use technology for social improvement.improvement.</p>
            
            <h2>EARLY INSPIRATIONS</h2>
            <p>Building structures from my first Lego set,
                ignited my passion for making things. Since then, my love for creation has just increased. 
                </p>

            <h2>CURIOSITY, AMUSEMENT</h2>
            <p>I have a deep desire to be able to learn as much as I can in the tech industry. Besides my massive bend for space research, I'm deeply interested in computer science because it's like a huge void of unending things yet to be discovered, every single day I'm amused from the weirdest unknown thing I realise can be achieved using technology.</p>

            <h2>JOURNEY</h2>
            <p>My journey from scoring 60% in my grade 11 exams to a 94% in grade 12 has been an arduous one, getting rid of inhibitions, negative attitudes, procrastination and lack of motivation. I learned to love what I do and do what I love.</p>

            <h2>FINDING SOLUTIONS</h2>
            <p>The biggest thing I've learned from my first few months at university is how much I love solving problems, the joy and adrenaline rush I get from every math, CS question I solve is worth the nerve wrecking, brain spending energy I spend on it and although stressful, it's totally worth it.</p>
